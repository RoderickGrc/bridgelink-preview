# BridgeLink Preview

BridgeLink is a web-based communication tool designed to facilitate communication between hearing-impaired and visually-impaired individuals. This repository contains a static frontend preview of the BridgeLink application, which simulates backend responses for demonstration purposes.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide a fully interactive frontend demo of BridgeLink without requiring a live backend server. This is achieved by mocking API REST and WebSocket communications directly within the JavaScript code.

## Features

- **Simulated Backend:** API REST calls and WebSocket communications are simulated to provide a realistic user experience.
- **Voice Recognition Mock:** Simulates voice input and processing.
- **LESSA Module Mock:** Simulates real-time sign language recognition.
- **Text Simplification:** Demonstrates text simplification features.
- **Interactive UI:** Fully functional user interface with state management and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Informative Modal:** A modal provides information about the project and its purpose.
